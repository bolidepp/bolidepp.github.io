BTG&nbsp; solutions ( “BTG “&nbsp;) provides:<br>
(1) a BTG &nbsp;user account that may be accessed through mobile apps,(2)
services accessible through the mobile apps,(3) software that may be downloaded
to your smartphone, tablet, laptop and desktop to access services (“Mobile
Apps”), and (4) subscription services, including services that can be accessed
using the Mobile Apps (“Subscription Services”), all for use in conjunction
with BTG &nbsp;hardware products (“Products”) and in other ways that BTG
&nbsp;provides. Some BTG products and Services can be used together or in ways
that integrate with products and services from third parties. The term
“Services” means the Mobile Apps, and Subscription Services.<br>
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Services.
These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other legal
rights in addition, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The
disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these Terms will
not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages or other rights, so those provisions of
these Terms may not apply to you.<br>
THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT. BY ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE
ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY YOU
REPRESENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACCESS. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU
HAVE THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND CAPACITY TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON
BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF
SUFFICIENT LEGAL AGE IN YOUR JURISDICTION OR RESIDENCE TO USE OR ACCESS THE
SERVICES AND TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE
PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD DISCONNECT YOUR PRODUCTS FROM YOUR
ACCOUNT (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND CEASE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES.<br>
AS DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE UPDATE OF THE
SERVICES AND OF THE PRODUCTS CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE,
YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICES.<br>
AS DESCRIBED BELOW, SECTIONS 4 AND 5 DESCRIBE IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS OF THE
SERVICES, ESPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH LIFE SAFETY AND CRITICAL USES. PLEASE
READ THESE DISCLOSURES CAREFULLY, AS YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THEM AND ACCEPTING
THEM.<br>
Overview, Eligibility, Customer Service, Term and Termination<br>
(a)Overview and Relation to Other Agreements.<br>
These Terms govern your use of the Services. Your purchase of any Product is
governed by the limited warranty provided with that Product (“Limited
Warranty”) and may further be governed by the Terms &amp; Conditions of Sale.
The software embedded in the Product (and any updates thereto) (“Product
Software”) is licensed and governed by the End User Licensing Agreement.
Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines,
terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Services in connection with such
features. All additional guidelines, terms, or rules, and the Privacy Statement
(“Privacy Statement”), are incorporated by reference into these Terms and you
are agreeing to accept and abide by them by using the Services.<br>
(b)Eligibility.<br>
You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with BTG, and
only if you are in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local,
state/provincial, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. Any
use or access to the Services by anyone under the age of 18 is strictly
prohibited and is a violation of these Terms. The Services are not available to
any users previously prohibited from using the Services by BTG.<br>
(c)Customer Service.<br>
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the Products, the Services, or
these Terms, please contact BTG. (d)Term and Termination.<br>
These Terms will remain in full force and effect so long as you continue to
access or use the Services, or until terminated in accordance with the
provisions of these Terms. At any time, BTG may (i) suspend or terminate your
rights to access or use the Services, or (ii) terminate these Terms with
respect to you if BTG in good faith believes that you have used the Services in
violation of these Terms, including any incorporated guidelines, terms or
rules. If you transfer a Product to a new owner, your right to use the Services
with respect to that Product automatically terminates, and the new owner will
have no right to use the Product or Services under your Account (as described
below) and will need to register for a separate Account with BTG .<br>
(e)Effect of Termination.<br>
Upon termination of these Terms, your Account and your right to use the
Services will automatically terminate.<br>
Accounts<br>
To use the Services, you must register for a user account (“Account”) and
provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the applicable
registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all required
registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will
maintain the accuracy of such information; and (c) your use of the Services
does not violate any U.S. or other applicable law or regulation (e.g., you are
not located in an embargoed country or are not listed as a prohibited or
restricted party under applicable export control laws and regulations). You are
entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login
information and for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to
use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower
case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account, and to maintain your password
securely to prevent others from gaining access without your permission. You
agree to immediately notify BTG of any unauthorized use, or suspected
unauthorized use, of your Account or any other breach of security. BTG&nbsp;is
not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the
above requirements.<br>
Access to Services<br>
(a)Access and Use.<br>
Subject to these Terms, BTG &nbsp;grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive,
right (without the right to sublicense) to access and use the Services by using
the Mobile Apps in connection with, and solely for the purpose of, controlling
and monitoring the Products installed on your property or otherwise accessing a
service explicitly provided by BTG &nbsp;for your use (the “Permitted
Purpose”).<br>
(b)Automatic Software Updates.<br>
BTG may from time to time develop patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades and
other modifications to improve the performance of the Services and/or the
Product Software (“Updates”). These may be automatically installed without
providing any additional notice or receiving any additional consent. You
consent to this automatic update. If you do not want such Updates, your remedy
is to terminate your Account and stop using the Services and the Product. If
you do not terminate a previously created Account, you will receive Updates
automatically. You acknowledge that you may be required to install Updates to
use the Services and the Product and you agree to promptly install any Updates BTG
provides. Your continued use of the Services and the Product is your agreement
– (i) to these Terms with respect to the Services, and (ii) to the End User
License Agreement with respect to updated Product Software.<br>
(c)Interface to Third Party Products and Services.<br>
Over time, BTG &nbsp;may provide the opportunity for you to interface the
Products and Services to one or more third party products and services, through
and using the Services, for example through the Works with BTG &nbsp;platform
(“Third Party Products and Services”). You decide whether and with which Third
Party Products and Services you want to interface. Your explicit consent and
authorization is required for this interface, and is revocable by you at any
time. Once your consent is given for a particular Third Party Product and
Service, you agree that BTG may exchange information and control data regarding
you and your products, including your personal information, in order to enable
the interface you have authorized. Once this information is shared with the
particular Third Party Product and Service, its use will be governed by the
third party's privacy policy and not by BTG's privacy documentation. You
acknowledge and agree that BTG makes no representation or warranty about the
safety of any Third Party Products or Services. Accordingly, BTG is not
responsible for your use of any Third Party Product or Service or any personal
injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home),
or other harm or losses arising from or relating to your use of any Third Party
Products or Services. You should contact the third party with any questions
about their Third Party Products and Services.<br>
(d)Certain materials may be displayed or performed on the Services (including,
but not limited to text, graphics, articles, photographs, video, images, and
illustrations (“Content”).<br>
The Content also includes information that you and other users provide us in
the course of using the Services (collectively, “User Submissions”), which we
may use to provide, maintain and improve the Services. Some content may be
visible to others (for example, the Service allows you to upload, post, or
otherwise share video content). You may also post feedback, comments,
questions, or other information on the website. You are solely responsible for
all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise disseminate
using, or in connection with, the Services, or that you contribute in any
manner to the Services; you represent and warrant that you have all rights
necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it; and you license
to BTG&nbsp;all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary
rights in and to such Content for publication on the Service pursuant to these
Terms. You shall abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information,
and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services, and
shall not use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit,
distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for
any purposes whatsoever any Content or third party submissions or other
proprietary rights not owned by you: (i) without the express prior written
consent of the respective owners, and (ii) in any way that violates any third
party right. BTG reserves the right to remove any Content from the Services at
any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims
or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if
we are concerned that you may have breached the immediately preceding
sentence), or for no reason at all.<br>
(e)Certain Restrictions.<br>
The rights granted to you in these Terms are subject to the following
restrictions: (i) you agree not to license, sell, rent, lease, transfer,
assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services; (ii)
you agree not to modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse
compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services; (iii) you agree not to
access the Services in order to build a similar or competitive service; (iv)
except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Services may be copied,
reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted, or transmitted
in any form or by any means; (v) you agree not to upload, transmit, or
distribute any computer viruses, worms, or any software intended to damage or
alter a computer or communication network, computer, handheld mobile device,
data, the Services, the Product, the Product Software, or any other system,
device or property; (vi) you agree not to interfere with, disrupt, or attempt
to gain unauthorized access to, the servers or networks connected to the
Services or violate the regulations, policies, or procedures of such networks;
(vii) you agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by
means other than through the interface that is provided by BTG ; and (viii) you
agree not to remove, obscure or alter any proprietary rights notices (including
copyrights and trademark notices) which may be contained in or displayed in
connection with the Services. Any future release, update, or other addition to
functionality of the Services shall be subject to these Terms.<br>
(f)Open Source.<br>
Certain items of independent, third party code may be included in the Mobile
Apps that are subject to the GNU General Public License (“GPL”) or other open
source licenses (“Open Source Software”). The Open Source Software is licensed
under the terms of the license that accompanies such Open Source Software.
Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under, or grants you rights that
supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end user license for such
Open Source Software. In particular, nothing in these Terms restricts your
right to copy, modify, and distribute such Open Source Software that is subject
to the terms of the GPL.<br>
(g)Privacy Statement.<br>
Please review the Privacy Statement. The Privacy Statement describes practices
regarding the information that BTG may collect from users of the Products and
Services, including any Content or User Submissions.<br>
(h)Security.<br>
BTG&nbsp;cares about the integrity and security of your personal information.
However, BTG cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able
to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper
purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your
own risk.<br>
(i)Modification.<br>
BTG reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the
Services or any part thereof with or without notice. You agree that BTG&nbsp;will
not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or
discontinuance of the Services or any part thereof.<br>
(j)Access Outside Certain Countries.<br>
Although the website is accessible worldwide, the Products and Services
provided or accessed through mobile apps are not available to all persons or in
all countries. If you choose to access the mobile apps from outside a country,
you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying
with applicable local laws in your country. You understand and accept that the
mobile apps are not designed for use in a non-Target Country and some or all of
the features of the mobile apps may not work or be appropriate for use in such
a country. To the extent permissible by law, BTG&nbsp;accepts no responsibility
or liability for any damage or loss caused by your accessing or use of the
mobile apps or BTG Products in a non-Target Country. You will be bound by these
Terms wherever you access or use the mobile apps or use the Services.<br>
Agreed Usage and Limitations Of BTG Services<br>
(a)Intended Use of BTG &nbsp;Services.<br>
The Services are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical
information and control of BTG products. While we aim for the Services to be
highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be reliable or
available 100% of the time. The Services are subject to sporadic interruptions
and failures for a variety of reasons beyond BTG’s control, including Wi-Fi
intermittency, service provider uptime, mobile notifications and carriers,
among others. You acknowledge these limitations and agree that BTG is not
responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of the
Services to reflect current status or notifications.<br>
(b)No Life-Safety or Critical Uses of the Services.<br>
You acknowledge and agree that the Products and Services, whether standing
alone or when interfaced with third-party products or services are not
certified for emergency response. BTG makes no warranty or representation that
use of the Products or Services with any third-party product or service will
affect or increase any level of safety. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES, WHETHER STANDING ALONE OR INTERFACED WITH THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR
SERVICES, ARE NOT A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM -- BTG WILL
NOT DISPATCH EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES TO YOUR HOME IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.
In addition, the BTG Customer Care and Support contacts cannot be considered a
lifesaving solution for people at risk in the home, and they are no substitute
for emergency services. All life threatening and emergency events should be
directed to the appropriate response services.<br>
(c)Reliability of Notifications.<br>
You acknowledge that the Services, including remote access and mobile
notifications, are not intended to be 100% reliable and 100% available. We
cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive notifications in any given
time or at all. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE
SAFETY OR CRITICAL PURPOSES. MOBILE NOTIFICATIONS REGARDING THE STATUS AND
ALARMS ON YOUR BTG PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY – THEY
ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.
The information provided by BTG&nbsp;on what to do in an emergency is based on
authoritative safety sources, but there is no way for BTG to provide specific
information relating to a situation in your home or elsewhere. You acknowledge that
it is your responsibility to educate yourself on how to respond to an emergency
and to respond according to the specifics of your situation.<br>
(d)Temporary Suspension.<br>
The Services may be suspended temporarily without notice for security reasons,
system failure, maintenance and repair, or other circumstances. You agree that
you will not be entitled to any refund or rebate for such suspensions. BTG&nbsp;does
not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the Services.<br>
(e)System Requirements.<br>
The Services will not be accessible without: (i) a working Wi-Fi network in
your home that is positioned to communicate reliably with the Products; (ii) an
Account; (iii) mobile clients such as a supported phone or tablet (required
from some functionality); (iv) always-on broadband Internet access in your
home; and (v) other system elements that may be specified by BTG. It is your
responsibility to ensure that you have all required system elements and that
they are compatible and properly configured. You acknowledge that the Services
may not work as described when the requirements and compatibility have not been
met. In addition, you acknowledge that BTG &nbsp;may activate Wifi on your
smartphone or tablet, with or without prior notification, in order to
facilitate proper operation of the Services, enable communication with BTG
&nbsp;Products connected to the same BTG &nbsp;account, and enable certain
features (such as AirLink Auto).<br>
(f)Energy Savings and other Benefits.<br>
Unless explicitly promising a “guarantee,” BTG&nbsp;does not guarantee or promise
any specific level of energy savings or other monetary benefit from the use of
the Products or Services or any feature of them. Actual energy savings and
monetary benefits vary with factors beyond BTG’s control or knowledge. From
time to time, BTG may use the Services to provide you with information that is
unique to you and your energy usage and suggests an opportunity to save money
on energy bills if you adopt suggestions or features of the Product or
Services. We do this to highlight an opportunity based on our analysis and
information about you and your household. You acknowledge that these promotions
are not a guarantee of actual savings, and you agree not to seek monetary or
other remedies from BTG if your savings differ.<br>
(g)The Services provide you information (“Product Information”) regarding the
Products in your home and their connection with other products and services.<br>
All Product Information is provided “as is” and “as available”. We cannot
guarantee that it is correct or up to date. In cases where it is critical,
accessing Product Information through the Services is not a substitute for
direct access of the information in the home.<br>
(h)All information publicly posted or privately transmitted through the
Services is the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content
originated and BTG will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any
Content.<br>
BTG cannot guarantee the identity of any other users with whom you may interact
in the course of using the Services.Additionally, we cannot guarantee the
authenticity of any data that users or merchants may provide about themselves.
You acknowledge that all Content accessed by you using the Services is at your
own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party
resulting therefrom. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action
regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may
take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release
us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through
the Services.<br>
(i)You warrant, represent and agree that you will not contribute any Content or
otherwise use the Services in a manner<br>
(i) infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or proprietary rights,
rights of publicity or privacy, or other rights of any third party; (ii)
violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (iii) is harmful,
fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory,
vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; (iv) impersonates any
person or entity, including without limitation any employee or representative
of BTG ; (v) contains a virus, trojan horse, worm, time bomb, or other harmful
computer code, file, or program; (vi) jeopardizes the security of your BTG
&nbsp;Account or anyone else’s Account (such as allowing someone else to log in
to the Services as you; (vii) attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password,
account, or other security information from any other user; (viii) violates the
security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security
encryption codes; (ix) runs Maillist, Listserv, or any form of auto-responder
or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that otherwise interfere with the
proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on
the Services’ infrastructure); (x) copies or stores any significant portion of
the Content; or (xi) decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to
obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the
Services. (j)Data protection and privacy laws where you live may impose certain
responsibilities on you and your use of the Products and Services. You agree
that you (and not BTG) are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any
applicable laws when you use the Products and Services, including but not
limited to (i) any laws relating to the recording or sharing of video or audio
content that includes third parties, or (ii) any laws requiring notice to or
consent of third parties with respect to your use of BTG Products.<br>
Limitations Of BTG Services Due to Third Parties.<br>
(a)General.<br>
BTG&nbsp;Services rely on or interoperate with third party products and
services. These third party products and services are beyond BTG’s control, but
their operation may impact or be impacted by the use and reliability of the BTG
Services. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) the use and availability of the
Services is dependent on third party product vendors and service providers,
(ii) these third party products and services may not operate in a reliable
manner 100% of the time, and they may impact the way that the BTG Services
operate, and (iii) BTG is not responsible for damages and losses due to the
operation of these third party products and services.<br>
(b)Third Party Service Providers Used By BTG.<br>
You acknowledge that BTG uses third party service providers to enable some
aspects of the Services – such as, for example, data storage, synchronization,
and communication through Amazon Web Services, and mobile device notifications
through mobile operating system vendors and mobile carriers. YOU AGREE NOT TO
RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR TIME-CRITICAL PURPOSES.<br>
(c)Equipment, ISP, and Carrier.<br>
You acknowledge that the availability of the Services is dependent on (i) your
computer, mobile device, home wiring, home Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth connection,
and other related equipment (“Equipment”), (ii) your Internet service provider
(“ISP”), and (iii) your mobile device carrier (“Carrier”). You acknowledge that
you are responsible for all fees charged by your ISP and Carrier in connection
with your use of the Services. You also acknowledge that you are responsible
for compliance with all applicable agreements, terms of use/service, and other
policies of your ISP and Carrier.<br>
(d)Third Party Products and Services that Work With BTG Services.<br>
BTG may provide the opportunity for you to interface to Third Party Products
and Services, for example through the Works with BTG platform. Although the
Works with BTG &nbsp;platform is offered by BTG , you acknowledge that Third
Party Products and Services that you connect to your account or interface with
are not BTG &nbsp;products and services and you acknowledge and agree that BTG
&nbsp;does not control, and that these Terms do not apply to, any Third Party
Products and Services. Use of any Third Party Products and Services is governed
by separate terms and conditions provided by the operator(s) of the applicable
Third Party Products and Services. You acknowledge and agree that BTG makes no
representation or warranty about the safety of any Third Party Products or
Services. Accordingly, BTG&nbsp;is not responsible for your use of any Third
Party Product or Service or any personal injury, death, property damage
(including, without limitation, to your home), or other harm or losses arising
from or relating to your use of any Third Party Products or Services. You
should contact the Third Party with any questions about their Products and
Services.<br>
(e)App Stores.<br>
You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Mobile Apps is dependent
on the third party websites from which you download the Mobile Apps, e.g., the
App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an “App
Store”). You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and BTG and not with
an App Store. Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you
must agree before downloading Mobile Apps from it. You agree to comply with,
and your license to use the Mobile Apps is conditioned upon your compliance
with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and
conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict
with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or
conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply.<br>
(f)Third Party Website Links and Referrals.<br>
The website may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties
(“Third Party Sites”) and referrals to third party vendors (“Referred
Vendors”). Such Third Party Sites and Referred Vendors are not under our
control. BTG&nbsp;provides these links and referrals only as a convenience and
does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any
representations with respect to such Third Party Sites or Referred Vendors.
Your use of these Third Party Sites is at your own risk.<br>
(g)Release Regarding Third Parties.<br>
BTG is not responsible for third parties or their products and services,
including, without limitation, the App Stores, Third Party Products and
Services, Third Party Sites, Referred Vendors, Equipment, ISPs, and Carriers. BTG
hereby disclaims and you hereby discharge, waive and release BTG and its
licensors and suppliers from any past, present, and future claims, liabilities,
and damages, known or unknown, arising out of or relating to your interactions
with such third parties and their products and services. YOU HEREBY WAIVE
CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH
STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES
NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION.<br>
Ownership and Intellectual Property<br>
(a)BTG &nbsp;Property.<br>
You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights, including without
limitation copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, in the Product,
Product Software, and Services (i.e., Mobile Apps) are owned by BTG or its

Disputes and Arbitration<br>
(a)Contact BTG &nbsp;First.<br>
If a dispute arises between you and BTG, our goal is to learn about and address
your concerns. You agree that you will notify BTG about any dispute you have
with BTG regarding these Terms or our Products or Services by contacting BTG .<br>
(b)Binding Arbitration.<br>
You and BTG&nbsp;agree, subject to clause 11(c) (Protection of Confidentiality
and Intellectual Property Rights), to submit any claim, dispute, action, cause
of action, issue, or request for relief arising out of or relating to these
Terms or your use of the Services to binding arbitration rather than by filing
any lawsuit in any forum other than set forth in this section. Further you
agree arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review
by a court. You also waive your right to any form of appeal, review or recourse
to any court or other judicial authority, insofar as such waiver may be validly
made. This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all
disputes or claims arising out of or relating to your use of the Service.
Subject to clause 11(c) (Protection of Confidentiality and Intellectual
Property Rights), any dispute or claim made by you against us or us against you
arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services (whether
based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal
theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration except that you may take claims
to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.<br>
(c)Arbitration Procedures.<br>
You must first present any claim or dispute to us by contacting BTG&nbsp;to
allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You may request arbitration if
your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days after presenting the
claim or dispute to BTG. BTG&nbsp;may request arbitration against you at any
time after it has notified you of a claim or dispute in accordance with clause
11(f) (Notifications). The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be
conducted in accordance with the then current and applicable rules of the
American Arbitration Association as modified by this agreement. The place of
any arbitration will be San Francisco, California, USA, and will be conducted
in the English language. Claims will be heard by a single arbitrator. The
arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or contrary to what this agreement
provides, order consolidation or arbitration on a class wide or representative
basis, award punitive or consequential damages or any other damages aside from
the prevailing party’s actual damages, or order injunctive or declaratory
relief, except that the arbitrator may award on an individual basis damages
required by statute and may order injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to
an applicable consumer protection statute. Any arbitration shall be
confidential, and neither you, nor BTG&nbsp;nor the arbitrator may disclose the
existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by
law or for purposes of enforcement or appeal of the arbitration award. Judgment
on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper
jurisdiction. If any portion of this arbitration clause is determined by a
court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full
force and effect.<br>
(d)No Class Actions.<br>
There shall be no right or authority for any claims subject to this arbitration
clause to be arbitrated on a class action or consolidated basis or on bases
involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
the general public (including, but not limited to, as a private attorney
general).<br>
(e)Fees and Expenses.<br>
All administrative fees and expenses of arbitration will be divided equally
between you and BTG. Each party will bear the expense of its own counsel,
experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the
arbitration hearing.<br>
(f)YOU MUST CONTACT BTG WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF
THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE, OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE
ANY CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS, OR DISPUTE.<br>
Digital Millennium Copyright Act<br>
(a)If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any
Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant
to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) by providing our
Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C
512(c)(3) for further detail): (i) A physical or electronic signature of a
person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed; (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to
have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site
are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that
site; (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to
which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the
service provider to locate the material; (iv) Information reasonably sufficient
to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone
number, and, if available, an electronic mail; (v) A statement that you have a
good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) A statement
that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of
perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
right that is allegedly infringed. (b)Counter-Notice. If you believe that your
Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing,
or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's
agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content,
you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the
Copyright Agent: (i) Your physical or electronic signature; (ii) Identification
of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and
the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
(iii) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was
removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the
Content; and (iv) Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a
statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in San
Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process
from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. (c)If a
counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, BTG may send a copy of the
counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it
may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.
Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the
Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or
access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the
counter-notice, at BTG's sole discretion.<br>
General<br>
(a)Changes to these Terms.<br>
BTG reserves the right to make changes to these Terms. We'll post notice of
modifications to these Terms on this page. You should ensure that you have read
and agree with our most recent Terms when you use the Services. Continued use
of the Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your
acknowledgment of such changes and agreement to be bound by the revised Terms.<br>
(b)Governing Law.<br>
The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of
disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is
excluded from applying, your country's laws will apply to such disputes related
to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that these Terms, and any claim, dispute,
action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief arising out of or
relating to these Terms or your use of the Products and Services shall be
governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any
conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of
another jurisdiction. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
state and federal courts in or for Santa Clara County, California for the
purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes, unless such claim or dispute
is required to be arbitrated as set forth in an above section.<br>
(c)Protection of Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights.<br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, BTG may seek injunctive or other equitable
relief to protect its confidential information and intellectual property rights
or to prevent loss of data or damage to its servers in any court of competent
jurisdiction.<br>
(d)Entire Agreement/Severability.<br>
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and BTG&nbsp;regarding
the use of the Services. Any failure by BTG&nbsp;to exercise or enforce any
right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right
or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and
have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms is, for
any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these
Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by
law. Neither party is an agent or partner of the other party.<br>
(e)Survivability.<br>
The obligations in Sections 3(d), 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13 will survive any
expiration or termination of these Terms.<br>
(f)Assignment.<br>
These Terms, and any associated rights or obligations, may not be assigned or
otherwise transferred by you without BTG’s prior written consent. These Terms
may be assigned by BTG&nbsp;without restriction. These Terms are binding upon
any permitted assignee.<br>
(g)Notifications.<br>
BTG &nbsp;may provide notifications to you as required by law or for marketing
or other purposes via (at its option) email to the primary email associated
with your Account, mobile notifications, hard copy, or posting of such notice. BTG&nbsp;is
not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may
apply to email notifications.<br>
